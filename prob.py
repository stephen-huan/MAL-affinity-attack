"""
automatic determination of depth
a node at depth d covers 2^(D - 1 - d) leaf nodes (ideally)
what's the chance that all these leaf nodes aren't covered?

Suppose we have a string of 1's and 0's, N characters total and M 1's.
Chance of at least one "1" in the first K characters?
Complementary counting: only way for there not be any 1's in the first K
is if all the 1's are in the other N - K positions. (N - K) choose M,
divide by the N choose M total ways to generate the string.

need to know size of list but impossible to know a priori,
unless a full database query is done (which defeats the point...)

NOTE: the above logic doesn't work because it isn't random:
the algorithm prunes subtrees so later depths actually have a high likelihood
